One time, to know that it's real
One time, to know how it feels
That's all.
One call, your voice on the phone
One place, a moment alone
That's all.

What do you see?
What do you know?
What are the signs?
What do I do?
Just follow your lifeline through.
What if it hurts?
What then?
What do you do?
What do you say?
Don't throw your lifelines away.
Don't throw your lifelines away.
